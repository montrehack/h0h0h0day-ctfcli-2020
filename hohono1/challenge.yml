  Santa decided to take the digital turn and to use the not-so-famous Ho Ho Hoperating System for managing his nice and naughty list. However, he has some difficulties using the system. 

  Can you recover the content of the file `1337`? If his memory is not failing him, it should be where he saved his list. Take the time to look at the End User Manual, it contains a lot of information that can be of use to you.

  * user: h3s 
  * pass: santa 
  * hostname: challenges.montrehack.ca
  * port: 8022

  ```shell
  ssh h3s@challenges.montrehack.ca -p 8022
  ```
