# Ho Ho No - Part 1 - By Zuyoutoki
Santa decided to take the digital turn and to use the not-so-famous Ho Ho Hoperating System for managing his nice and naughty list. However, he has some difficulties using the system. 

Can you recover the content of the file `1337`? If his memory is not failing him, it should be where he saved his list. Take the time to look at the End User Manual, it contains a lot of information that can be of use to you.
