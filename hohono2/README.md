# Ho Ho No - Part 2 - By Zuyoutoki
Santa decided to take the digital turn and to use the not-so-famous Ho Ho Hoperating System for managing his nice and naughty list. However, he has some difficulties using the system. 

  It seems that the previous file was not the right one... It must have been a prank pulled by Dio the Mischievious Elf! Unfortunately, he is not at the toy shop at the moment so you can't ask him where he put them. Waiting for his return, you discover a secret password protected page in the system! You can access it by typing 'secret' when you are prompted for code. Can you find a way to break in?

 * Try searching for polyglot files. PoC||GTFO has a few great articles about that.
