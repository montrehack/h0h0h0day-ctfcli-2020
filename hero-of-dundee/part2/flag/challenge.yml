    Dundonian,

    Well done for getting your hands on the message addressed to Zargothrax !
    In the meantime, the captured minion as spoken : there seems to be some kind of magic device, that could delay the attack.
    He told us 

    ```shell
    on port 27777, you'll find our secret weapon. But it's already too late, you won't be able to stop us now !
    ```

    If you need help for this one, you can ask our mage, Caesar.
