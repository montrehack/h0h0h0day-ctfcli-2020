O great Chaos Wizard,

I wanted to inform you, that despite an intensive use of our whips, our slaves were not able to quite finish our new recruitment platform in time.
The thing is, we didn't want to impose a crunch to them, we are not evil after all.

Oh wait, WE ARE THE EVIL.
I've already burned them to crisps.

A new team as already taken over.
If you want, you can take a look at their work:
challenges.montrehack.ca:31080.

Please, keep in mind that's still a work in progress.
I'm truly sorry for failing your confidence, and beg you not to scorch me alive for this.

Zangdar.
