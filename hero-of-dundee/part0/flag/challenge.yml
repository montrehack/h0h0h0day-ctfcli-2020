    Dundonian, we desesperatly need you

    Our scouts just told us that Zargothrax is planning an attack on our beautiful town.
    We are trying to gather as much soldiers as possible. Time has come to raise our defenses. 

    I can't be by your side right now, as I need to find the Amulet of Justice, and the mighty Hammer Of Glory, if we want to stand a chance...

    Good news is, Zargothrax minions might be more stupid than we thought: one of them was captured, with a book containing informations. It looked like some kind of magic spell. One of my lieutenant suggested you might be helpful with this.

    ```
    minion stands for my username
    on my device, a secure shell you'll open
    to port 31625, you shall be connected
    by entering myEvilPass when prompted
    ```

    Good luck !
