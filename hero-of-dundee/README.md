Dundonian, we desesperatly need you

Our scouts just told us that Zargothrax is planning an attack on our beautiful town.
We are trying to gather as much soldiers as possible. Time has come to raise our defenses. 

I can't be by your side right now, as I need to find the Amulet of Justice, and the mighty Hammer Of Glory, if we want to stand a chance...

Good news is, Zargothrax minions might be more stupid than we thought: one of them was captured, with a book containing informations. It looked like some kind of magic spell. One of my lieutenant suggested you might be helpful with this.

```
minion stands for my username
on my device, a secure shell you'll open
to port 31625, you shall be connected
by entering myEvilPass when prompted
```

Good luck !

O great Chaos Wizard,

I wanted to inform you, that despite an intensive use of our whips, our slaves were not able to quite finish our new recruitment platform in time.
The thing is, we didn't want to impose a crunch to them, we are not evil after all.

Oh wait, WE ARE THE EVIL.
I've already burned them to crisps.

A new team as already taken over.
If you want, you can take a look at their work:
challenges.montrehack.ca:31080.

Please, keep in mind that's still a work in progress.
I'm truly sorry for failing your confidence, and beg you not to scorch me alive for this.

Zangdar.

Dundonian,

Well done for getting your hands on the message addressed to Zargothrax !
In the meantime, the captured minion as spoken : there seems to be some kind of magic device, that could delay the attack.
He told us 

```
on port 27777, you'll find our secret weapon. But it's already too late, you won't be able to stop us now !
```

If you need help for this one, you can ask our mage, Caesar.
