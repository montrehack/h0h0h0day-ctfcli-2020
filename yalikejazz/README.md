# Ya like jazz?

The flag is encoded with Bacon's cipher (Google it to find online tools to encode/decode it).
It's basically binary that encodes only the alphabet and therefore only uses 5 bits.
Traditionally it uses letters A for 0 and B for 1, but we can use anything we want.

In this challenge, the flag is encoded in the piano part.
If the piano plays a chord with a 7 (minor or major), it's a 'B' character, otherwise it's an 'A' character.

> WHAT? But I don't have any musical knowledge! How am I supposed to solve this?

Fret not my dear friend, all the relevant information has been written down for you.
The chord name on top of every piano chord will tell you all you need to know.

> Which files do I need?

- sheet-flag.pdf is the sheet music WITH THE FLAG. It has only the piano part and the trumpet part (for reference).
- jingle-bells.mp3 is the song as rendered by MuseScore
- sheet-full.pdf is the full sheet music with trumpet, saxophones, piano, bass and drums, because why not I wrote the damn thing might as well give it out. It will not help you solve the challenge but it might satisfy your curiosity. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

That is all you need to know. Feel free to DM me if you're stuck. Good luck, have fun, and happy holidays! :)

REMEMBER: Flag format is FLAG[A-Z]+ (letters only, ALL UPPERCASE)
