  We found this executable along with a picture of a Gopher in a Santa hat. It's a dropper for another executable that was compiled with the same flags and versions.

  We have to enter a password to get it to decrypt the payload. Please help us figure out the password!

  **The flag for this challenge is the password you need to enter to get the decrypted payload.** It only contains characters from this set: `[A-Za-z0-9_]`.

  _The hint that costs 1 contains a link to the original source code for_ `main.deriveKey`
