  Ho ho ho, and wouldn't ya know? Santa loves Tic Tac Toe!
  You can play a match against Santa when he gets done finishing feeding the
  reindeer. If you win he'll give you a special Christmas present.

  Watch out though, he's very good! It is rumored an elf was able to beat him
  one time, but no one has managed to repeat the feat.

  Download the binary to practice and build a strategy, then when you're
  ready to take on Santa you can play him via his North Pole coordinates at
